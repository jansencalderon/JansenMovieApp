# JansenMovieApp

A sample app using MVVM, Realm, Retrofit, Dagger2, RxJava/Kotlin/Android and Clean Architecture.

Used MVVP for separation of concerns on layers of the app.
UI (Presentation), Domain and Data.
It also helps on handling lifecycle and orientation changes on Android.

Retrofit for network requests
Realm for local persistence, while room is easier to integrate, realm provides a query builder instead of using raw SQL
